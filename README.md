# Power Outage Model Analysis

This project was done as part of UCSD's DSC80 class.

## Framing the Problem

The goal of our analysis is to predict the **cause category** of an outage based on the **outage duration**, **numbers of customers affected**, **total price** of electricity during the outage, **NERC region**, and **climate category**. Since cause category is a categorical variable with 7 unique values, we are going to be performing a multiclass classification.
